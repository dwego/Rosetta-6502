## **ABOUT ME (short version)**

I’m Diego, a 15-year-old developer from Guarulhos, São Paulo, studying at a public high school and passionate about technology, mathematics, and building systems from scratch. I love exploring computer science in depth, learning new things every day, and spending my free time playing soccer and basketball. My dream is to study abroad, grow as a developer, and create projects that make a real difference in the world.

## **MY STORY**

My name is Diego, and my journey in technology began when I was 10 years old, experimenting with Python and trying to understand how computers truly work beneath the surface. Over time, what started as curiosity became a defining part of my life. I enjoy studying complex topics such as mathematics, low-level programming, computer architecture, and artificial intelligence.

I am a scholarship student in **Prandiano**, an advanced mathematics program focused on problem-solving and logical reasoning. This has helped strengthen my ability to think deeply, learn independently, and approach challenges with creativity and discipline.

Outside of technology, I enjoy sports — especially soccer and basketball — which help me stay balanced, active, and focused. I study in a public school, and even with the challenges that come with it, I always try to make the most of every opportunity. My goal is to continue learning, improving my English, studying abroad, and eventually working on projects that generate genuine social impact.

## **MAIN PROJECT — ROSETTA-6502**

Rosetta-6502 is my main personal project: a cycle-accurate virtual machine that emulates the classic MOS 6502 CPU architecture. The goal is to recreate the processor with full precision, including its instruction set, timing, memory interactions, interrupts, and hardware behavior.

The name “Rosetta” is inspired by both the **Rosetta Stone**, a key artifact for language translation, and **Apple’s Rosetta**, which translates between PowerPC and ARM architectures. My project follows the same idea: translating and deeply understanding how computer architectures work.

Rosetta-6502 is written in C and C++, with some assembly routines for critical components. It aims to be a platform for studying computer architecture, experimenting with low-level systems, and running 6502 programs with accurate behavior. The CPU and clock systems are functional, and memory modules are actively being expanded.

## **HACKATHONS**

### **Qualcomm Edge AI Hackathon — São Paulo**

My first hackathon took place at Cubo Itaú, where I met people who still collaborate with me today. My solution focused on creating edge AI agents for JVM core optimization — an idea that eventually evolved into the content of my Oracle presentation.

### **Devs de Impacto — OpenAI (São Paulo)**

This challenge focused on public services and supporting invisible communities. I created **Lumen**, a platform designed to identify underserved groups that appear in statistics but rarely receive real support.

### **Devs de Impacto — OpenAI (Curitiba, Paraná)**

At 15, I traveled out of my state to compete in Curitiba. It was an intense weekend: 36 hours coding nonstop, plus 7 hours of travel each way. My team built a climate-impact platform capable of predicting floods in Canoas, RS, up to 16 days in advance, using satellite data and a custom risk-scoring model.

### **NASA Space Apps — Campina Grande (Global Finalist)**

We created **tempo11.earth**, a platform based on the NASA TEMPO satellite that analyzes global air quality using the European AQI index. The system generates personalized risk scores for different profiles such as elderly individuals, pregnant women, and people with respiratory conditions, sending alerts when air quality becomes unsafe.
This project advanced to the **NASA Space Apps Global Finals**.

## **TALKS & PRESENTATIONS**

### **Oracle — AI Agents for Observability and JVM Optimization**

At 15, I was invited to present at Oracle about AI agents for observability and JVM core optimization.
I explained how intelligent edge agents can improve performance monitoring, detect failures more efficiently, and enhance Java systems at scale.
This experience was one of the milestones of my journey, showing me that age does not limit the impact you can create.

## **PROJECT EXPERIENCE**

I worked on several NFS-e mobile applications used across multiple Brazilian municipalities, including Campinas, Sorocaba, Teresina, São José dos Campos, João Pessoa, and others.
Built with **Flutter**, these apps involved backend integration, user flow design, and reliability improvements.
Additional projects will be added as I continue expanding my portfolio.
