   BMI - Branch if Minus:
   This function fetches a one-byte signed relative offset from memory,
   checks if the Negative flag is set, and if so, adds the offset to the
   program counter (PC), effectively branching to a new location. Cycle counts
   are adjusted accordingly, with extra cycles if the branch is taken and if it
   crosses a page boundary.
