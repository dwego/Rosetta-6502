/*
   This is a header file for the BPL (Branch if Positive) instruction for MOS
   Technology 6502. BPL branches to a new location if the Negative flag is
   clear (i.e., result is positive or zero).

   For more information about the instructions, refer to Instructions.MD

/*
   BPL - Branch if Positive:
   This function fetches a one-byte signed relative offset from memory,
   checks if the Negative flag is clear, and if so, adds the offset to the
   program counter (PC), effectively branching to a new location. Cycle counts
   are adjusted accordingly, with extra cycles if the branch is taken and if it
   crosses a page boundary.
