   This is a header file for the BNE (Branch if Not Equal) instruction for MOS
   Technology 6502. BNE branches to a new location if the Zero flag is clear
   (i.e., result was not zero).

/*
   BNE - Branch if Not Equal:
   This function fetches a one-byte signed relative offset from memory,
   checks if the Zero flag is clear, and if so, adds the offset to the program
   counter (PC), effectively branching to a new location. Cycle counts are
   adjusted accordingly, with extra cycles if the branch is taken and if it
   crosses a page boundary.
